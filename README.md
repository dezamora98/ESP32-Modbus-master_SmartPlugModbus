# charge-station

This project is a firmware for ESP32 microcontrollers that uses the FreeRTOS operating system. It provides functionality for a charge station focus on electric vechicles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [PlatformIO](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/vs-code-platformio-ide-esp32-esp8266-arduino/) - An VSCode extension that gives IDE functionality for firmware development.
- [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) - Real-time operating system

### Installing

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Alpha2W/charge-station.git`
2. Checkout master branch

### Running

1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer
2. Build and Upload the Firmware using PlatformIO tools
3. You can use PlatformIO serial monitor terminal and see the output of the firmware
